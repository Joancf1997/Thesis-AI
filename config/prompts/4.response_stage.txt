Response Generation Stage - With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. 
The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {question}, Task Planning: {plan}, Task Execution: {tool_outputs}. 
You must first answer the userâ€™s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person, 
but don't show the internal ids of the taks, only mention the name, model or objective of the task.
